## Project 1: PokeWeather Webpage

**Version 1.0**

# Description:

In this application we wanted to have a fun way for users to get the current weather and associate that with different pokemon. If the user types in a city location, then the page will display a 5 day weather forecast. Then, if the user selects a day in the forecast, that weather will pull up a list of Pokémon.

# User Story:

AS a Pokémon Gamer
I WANT to see Pokémon recommendations based on the weather
SO THAT I can understand how weather affects my Pokémon
